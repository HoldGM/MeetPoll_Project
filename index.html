<p>The Meet Poll project is an Android mobile app for group planning. Meet Poll will provide users with an easy method of planning and coordinating group meetings. Used for both formal and informal gatherings Meet Poll allows users an easy interface to plan events for a wide range of activities including formal and business dinners, study groups, hiking or camping, movies, religious events, and more. Meet Poll focus on the uncertainty problem that many groups have with planning when and where to meet. As anyone that has every tried to plan a group event will know, there is almost never unanimous agreement on where individuals want to go. While some may want a quick bite at a burger stand and others want to meet for a nicer dinner at a sit down restaurant, Meet Poll allows group members to make their voice heard and vote on where they would prefer to go. But Meet Poll provides more than just that, users will always be informed of event plans by including real time updates that keeps every group member up to date on when and where events are happening. With Meet Poll there is no more hassle of trying to keep track of who knows what information, it is all available on Meet Poll instantly. </p>
