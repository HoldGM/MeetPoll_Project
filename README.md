On home screen, open settings in the overflow menu to save your name.
Press the floating plus (+) button to create a new event.
In the new event page, fill in all of the details, these will be used to search for meeting locations around the specified location.
Press find places to find places matching your criteria.
On the map screen, press the back arrow on the top left to refine your search, or press the forward arrow in the top right to save the event.
The home screen should now display the event and a few of the details including the creator's name and picture(For now this is just a default image, but you will be able to choose a different image in the beta)
	Just for testing purposes, we have a "delete all events" button at the top of the home screen which will delete everything from the database.
