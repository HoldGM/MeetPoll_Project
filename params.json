Used for both formal and informal gatherings Meet Poll allows users an easy interface to plan events for a wide range of activities including formal and business dinners, study groups, hiking or camping, movies, religious events, and more. Meet Poll focus on the uncertainty problem that many groups have with planning when and where to meet. As anyone that has every tried to plan a group event will know, there is almost never unanimous agreement on where individuals want to go.

With Meet Poll there is no more hassle of trying to keep track of who knows what information, it is all available on Meet Poll instantly. \r\n\r\n###Upcoming Events\r\n<img src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/50tlqrrl9/Screenshot_20160915_002308.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\">\r\n\r\n###Create\r\n<img src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/iqjjltpbh/Screenshot_20160915_002219.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\"> ---> <img src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/ydasz733h/Screenshot_20160915_002232.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\"><img src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/ydasz733h/Screenshot_20160915_002232.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\">\r\n\r\n##Alpha Version: Initial user activities and map integration. \r\n\r\n###Features:\r\n\r\n• Splash Screen\r\n\r\n• Start up and loading screen will be viewable for a few seconds before users enter the app.\r\n• Event List\r\n\r\n• Main activity screen for the app.\r\n  • Chronological ordering of saved events\r\n  • Color coding of pending, waiting and confirmed events \r\n  • Event Creator\r\n\r\n• Users will be able to create an event.\r\n  • Determine search options: Location, venue type, save time and date information.\r\n  • Determine search area based on entered address or device GPS location\r\n  • Map Search\r\n\r\n• Map integration for venue search. \r\n  • Useable Google Maps API integration.\r\n\r\n###Beta Version:\r\n\r\nComplete app life cycle for event creation, invite and voting notifications, vote tallying, and detailed event viewer.\r\n\r\n###Features:\r\n\r\n• Backend interface\r\n\r\n• Set up backend notification server for pushing invite and voting notification to users. \r\n  •  Must be able to support data storage for voting response and location lists.\r\n  • Voting Response\r\n\r\n• Users will be able to return selected options to the originator for tallying\r\n  • Voting Results\r\n\r\n• Hosts of events will be able to see progress for number of responders vs. invitees\r\n  • Results screen will be able to total voting results and display results in order of most votes\r\n  • Events Detail\r\n\r\n• Full detail view of events from event list.\r\n  • Will display mini map of location, host contact links for SMS and telephone.\r\n  • Map will link to Map service for directions\r\n  • Telephone and SMS\r\n\r\n• Events will be linked to host contact information. \r\n• Telephone and SMS links will be available directly from the app but supported by outside app for permissions.\r\n\r\n##Future Release:\r\n\r\nIncrease internal functionality and support for third-party apps.\r\n\r\n##Features:\r\n\r\n• Increase venue options\r\n\r\n• Wider range of search criteria including bar/club, library, entertainment, and religious locations\r\n  • Support for custom search criteria.\r\n  • Calendar Integration • Event linking to internal calendar\r\n\r\n• In app SMS / Messenger \r\n  • Integrated SMS service with group SMS linked directly to individual events. \r\n  • Integration for Facebook Messenger to decrease need for outside apps for communication. \r\n  • Invite/Response list for Host and Invitees to see who is invited and who responded.\r\n\r\n• Facebook / Google+ \r\n  • Increased user base through Facebook and Google+ sign in credentials. \r\n  • Event creation that will link to Facebook and Google+ event managers.\r\n\r\n• Third-Party App integration \r\n  • Freemium upgrade to link to third-party app for easier event planning.\r\n\r\n• Opentable \r\n  • restaurant reservation service\r\n\r\n• Foursquare \r\n  • Location check-in \r\n  • Business ratings and review service\r\n\r\n• Yelp \r\n  • Restaurant ratings and reviews service\r\n\r\n• Zagat \r\n  • Restaurant ratings service.\r\n\r\n##Use Cases:\r\n*\r\n• User can easily track the preferred meeting location of multiple people without resorting to individual phone or SMS services.\r\n\r\n• Application can be scalable to larger group events for businesses or professional event planners.\r\n\r\n• Users will have a central location for seeing all upcoming events that they are planning or have been invited to.\r\n",
